              description="Iâ€™ve fine-tuned the Llama3.1_8B Meta model with a context window of 128k to support Arabic Language, This means the model can handle longer texts and understand Arabic better than ever before. This model has been fine-tuned using the LoRA method, leveraging high-quality Arabic datasets. The result is a model that can handle longer context windows, enabling more comprehensive understanding and generation of text in Arabic."
